                    <p>Everyone is talking about Carmen House, the project by <a class="links" target="_blank"
                            href="https://www.carlesfaus.com/">Valencian architect Carles Faus</a> that has become the
                        most famous house of the moment on social networks. </p>
                    <p><span class="en3">Light and white tones as the main elements</span> </p>
                    <p>Faus had a difficult challenge: to create inside the house the same beauty that already existed
                        outside, taking into account the incomparable setting in which it is located, Les Marines
                        (Denia). But he succeeded. </p>
                    <p>From the entrance, the house welcomes us with a large opening that conveys calm, sophistication
                        and elegance and where lighting is key. And the location of each of the spaces in the house has
                        been created from the path that the light follows throughout the day.</p> <br> <br><br><br>
                    <p>The Ibizan style used in the wall and floor coverings, combine perfectly with the minimalist and
                        natural decoration and the earthy colours, which evoke tranquillity. </p>
                    <p>All this makes us divert our attention to the interior of the house and allow ourselves to be
                        captivated by the white colour of the micro-cement used in the cladding, which acts as a
                        generator and conductor of light. </p> <img class="img-fluid"
                        src="https://www.topciment.com/imagenes/carmen-house/CARLES%20FAUS%20ARQUITECTURA%20-%20CARMEN%20HOUSE%20(8).jpg"
                        style=" display: block;" alt=" Carmen House interior and exterior cladding"

                    <p><span class="en3">Carmen House and Topciment</span></p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that Carmen House is one of those projects that inspire and in which every
                        detail counts: from its colours to the materials used to create it. </p>
                    <p>And, in this aspect, Topciment has a lot to do. Our microcement from the Sttandard range has been
                        key in the creation of this architectural work: </p>
                    <p>- Sttandardard Microdeck</a> in white and satin finish: for interior flooring
                        and wall cladding. <br> - Sttandard Microbase in white colour and satin finish: for outdoor
                        flooring. </p>
                    <p>At Topciment we have been manufacturing microcement for 15 years and offering solutions to
                        professionals to create high performance projects with high decorative grades such as Carmen
                        House. </p>
                    <p>If you want to carry out your work, we will be happy to advise you and help you build <a
                            href="../projects">projects</a> like this one. Because with microcement there are no
                        limits. </p>
