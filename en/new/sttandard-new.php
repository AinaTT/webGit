                <h1>Topciment presents Sttandard!</h1>
                <div class="headline wow fadeInRight estiloNormal16justificado">
                    <p>From Topciment we have decided to go a step further in terms of design and we have updated our
                        image and the aesthetics of our cubes. We present our range of Sttandard products, with the same
                        quality and features, but with a renewed image, much more visual and modern, without losing the
                        Topciment essence. <br><br> </p><img
                        src="https://www.topciment.com/imagenes/sttandard/Sttandard_Bodegon_Horizontal.jpg"
                        alt="Sttandard" width="100%" height="auto" /> <br><br>
                    <p>With this improvement we want to go up a step in terms of design and have the image that really
                        represents our brand. TOP material, TOP design. </p>
                    <p>In addition, we have associated a specific colour to each of the products to make it much easier
                        to identify them and thus facilitate the work of all the people who work with our materials.</p>
                    <p>The distinctive TT of Topciment gains prominence in this new design and has been the central axis
                        of this renewal of image and product naming. So the line of bicomponent microcements changes its
                        name. It is a risky step, but we are going from a very generic name like bicomponent, to one
                        made to measure for Topciment: Sttandard, always with our TT reinforcing the brand. </p>
                    <p>So, from now on our two-component microcements will be called: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <a href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard"> Sttandard Microbase 20KG</a>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard"> Sttandard Microfino 20KG</a>
                        </li>
                        <li> <a href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard">Sttandard Microstone
                                20KG</a></li>
                        <li>
                        <li> <a href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard">Sttandard Microdeck 20KG</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <li> <a href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard">Sttandard Aquaciment
                                20KG</a> </li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, this change is not only on an aesthetic level, but also the quality and ergonomics of
                        the buckets have been implemented, as we are not only focused on image but also on achieving the
                        best quality in everything surrounding Topciment.</p> <a
                        href="../microcements/two-component-microcement-sttandard"> <img
                            src="https://www.topciment.com/imagenes/sttandard/logo-sttandard-bn.jpg"
                            alt="Logo Sttandard" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
                    <p>With all these improvements, Topciment wants to reinforce its image and position itself as the
                        best microcement brand in terms of material quality and also in terms of design. Always without
                        forgetting the people who work with us, because everything is by and for them. </p>
