                    <h2>Microcement countertops? Of course it is! </h2>
                    <p>Let nothing ruin the <a style="text-decoration: underline;"
                            href="../new/kitchen-countertops-with-microcement">ideal kitchen project</a> you have
                        always dreamed of. The renovation or design of our kitchen, deserves foresight and good advice,
                        and in Topciment we work to offer you all the solutions related to your idea of reform with
                        microcement as a coating. It is important to define the style and range of colours, but also
                        technical and functional issues that facilitate movement, cleaning and use of space for cooking,
                        storage and enjoyment in a comfortable way in this area of the home.</p>
                    <h2>Microcement worktops are possible</h2>
                    <p>Currently, there are many materials to choose from for the design of our kitchen. In the case of
                        worktops, the choice of material should not be limited to a simple selection of colour or
                        texture, as, in areas such as the front of the worktop, the sink area and the hob area,
                        materials that are unalterable to stains and easy to clean are required. Likewise, it is
                        important to ensure a good section of worktop, especially next to the hob area, in order to work
                        comfortably.</p>
                    <p>In the field of worktop cladding, there has been an evolution in the types of material, with a
                        wide variety of solutions, with microcement being a practical and decorative cladding that will
                        give your kitchen style and personality. Its flexible, adaptable and resistant nature has made
                        microcement one of the ideal materials to be applied on any surface such as worktops.</p> <img

                        width="100%" alt="Kitchen worktops with Topciment">
                    <p>The elegance and timelessness of microcement makes it possible to cover and adapt its modelling
                        to surfaces of any shape and decorative style, from the most rustic and vintage to the most
                        urban and industrial. It has a natural mineral appearance that is very difficult to find in
                        other materials and can be combined with other types of elements (iron, concrete, wood...).
                        Likewise, its thin layer thickness makes it lighter than traditional marble or granite stone
                        pieces, with the advantage of being just as <a style="text-decoration: underline;"

                    <h2>Functionality and maintenance without complications</h2>
                    <p>Resistant to stains and dirt, microcement surfaces are easy to clean and require minimal
                        maintenance. As long as it is used properly and its simple cleaning and maintenance care is
                        followed, our microcement worktop will look as perfect as the first day, with the advantage of
                        carrying out future renovations of colours, finishes and styles in a simple and much cheaper way
                        than that offered by other materials.</p>
                    <p>With a good response to humidity and heat, it avoids the need for expansion joints, while
                        repelling water without allowing it to penetrate. Furthermore, in a space like the kitchen where
                        cleanliness is so important for food preparation, <a style="text-decoration: underline;"
