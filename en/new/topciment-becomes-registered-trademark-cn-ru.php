                <h1>We are now a registered trademark in China and Russia</h1>
                <div class="headline wow fadeInRight styleNormal16justified">
                    <p>Since we started our business in 2005, we have been growing and looking for improvements that
                        give our products added value and quality. </p>
                    <p>For this reason, we are happy to announce that our trademark TT Topciment has been registered in
                        China and the Russian Federation by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). </p>
                    <p>Registering our trademark in different countries is important because it allows us to limit
                        product plagiarism infringements and to prevent factors outside our company from taking
                        advantage of our reputation. </p>
                    <p>All of this gives our customers confidence, a fundamental aspect for our company. </p> <img

                        alt="Trademark in China and Russia">
                    <p>And we must not forget that brand is synonymous with quality. It is what identifies us and, above
                        all, what differentiates us from the competition. </p>
                    <p>That is why creating a brand and growing with it is an essential factor. </p>
                    <p>Now China and Russia have joined Europe in registering our TT Topciment brand, and we couldn't be
                        prouder to be moving forward. </p>
                    <p>And this is, without a doubt, a great step towards the future.
