                    <p>Microcement is one of the most widespread continuous floorings in the world
                        due to the decorative opportunities it offers for both indoors and outdoors.
                        A coating that can be applied on kitchen floors, bathroom floors, terrace
                        floors, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>A building material that, although it has years of history, has become much
                        more popular in recent years, especially for covering all types of flooring.
                        Here we show you everything you need to know about microcement flooring: how
                        it is applied, its main advantages, the types of microcement available for
                        floors, tips... and much more.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Benefits of microcement on floors</h2>
                    <p>Applying microcement on floors offers countless advantages. Here is a summary
                        of some of the most important benefits that this innovative decorative
                        coating can offer as flooring:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> It does not raise the level of the floor too much thanks to its minimum
                            thickness of between 2 and 3 mm. </li>
                        <li> It is a continuous floor, which means that there are no expansion
                            joints or joints. The entire floor renovation is done in one single
                            piece. </li>
                        <li>It adheres to any type of material without the need to remove the
                            existing substrate. It avoids generating debris and heavy renovations.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is unalterable to UV rays and has very good thermal resistance. </li>
                        <li>It has enviable resistance to traffic, abrasion and domestic cleaning
                            products. </li>
                        <li>No two microcement floors are alike thanks to the variety of colours and
                            finishes offered by this decorative covering. </li>
                        <li>It can be used as interior flooring but also as exterior flooring, for
                            example on terraces. </li>

                    <h2>How to install a microcement floor
                    </h2>
                    <p>Now that you know all the virtues of microcement flooring, it is time to
                        explain the application process. Here are the six steps to take into account
                        to install a microcement floor successfully:
                    </p>
                    <h3> 1. Cleaning the future microcement floor</h3>
                    <p>The flooring to be covered with microcement must be in perfect condition.
                        Therefore, the first step is to clean the future microcement floor of dust,
                        stains, grease or any other type of particles, as well as making sure that
                        the base is in perfect condition. It is very important to check the humidity
                        level of the floor, wait for it to dry or apply an impoxy barrier to block
                        rising damp or as a vapour barrier.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Primer</h3>
                    <p>Once the surface is clean, apply a coat of primer on the flooring to enhance
                        the adhesion between the existing substrate and the new microcement floor.
                        If the base surface is absorbent, such as concrete or self-levelling,
                        PRIMACEM ABS
                        <!-- (link) --> should be used; if it is non-absorbent, such as
                        terrazzo, tile or marble, PRIMACEM PLUS
                        <!-- <!-- (link) --> --&gt; should be used.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. First coat of microcement base </h3>
                    <p>After priming, apply the first layer of unpigmented microcement base. The use
                        of a fibreglass mesh is recommended, as it will help the professional to
                        minimise the chances of cracks appearing over time. Once applied, sand the
                        surface.
                    </p>
                    <h3>4. Second coat of microcement base</h3>
                    <p>Once the surface is completely dry, apply a second coat of pigmented
                        microcement base. In this step, choose the desired microcement colour to
                        cover the continuous flooring and, once the surface is perfectly covered,
                        sand the microcement floor.
                    </p>
                    <h3>5. Two coats of finishing microcement </h3>
                    <p>The fifth step consists of applying two coats of finishing microcement or
                        pigmented finish. Depending on the finish and the degree of slipperiness
                        desired, medium or thick microcement can be used. As specialists, we
                        recommend two coats of Microdeck, our medium microcement, which is optimal
                        for the application of microcement on floors.
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. Microcement floor protection</h3>
                    <p>The last step in the application of microcement on floors is one of the most
                        important. The microcement floor is ready, now it needs to be protected. To
                        do this, two coats of PRESEALER
                        <!-- (link) --> are applied by roller, followed by
                        two coats of TOPSEALER
                        <!-- (link) -->. In addition to protecting the microcement of
                        the floor, it can be waterproofed and even achieve an anti-slip finish.

                    <h2>Types of microcement for floors
                    </h2>
                    <p>If there is one particularity that perfectly defines microcement, it is its
                        versatility, as there are different types depending on the texture and
                        finish you want to obtain: one-component, two-component and ready-to-use. At
                        Topciment we have up to four different microcement systems for floors:
                    </p>
                    <p class="h3">
                        Two-component microcement</p>
                    <p>Two-component microcement (cement + resin) is undoubtedly one of the most
                        widely used in microcement flooring. For this reason, we have created two
                        lines: Sttandard
                        <!-- (link) -->, the traditional and one of the most popular; and
                        Unlimitted
                        <!-- (link) -->, the new range that provides smoother finishes and greater
                        mechanical resistance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="h3">
                        One-component microceme</p>
                    <p>Evoluttion
                        <!-- (link) -->, our one-component microcement for floors with excellent
                        mechanical resistance and high workability, is formulated with water and
                        cement. All types of microcement floors can be designed with it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Efectto Quartz
                        <!-- (link) --> is our ready-to-use microcement for floors. Thanks to
                        its wide range of colours and its four granulometries, you can create any
                        microcement floor you can imagine.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Microcement flooring in bathrooms and kitchens</h2>
                    <p>Microcement can be used both as exterior flooring and interior flooring in
                        any room. Among its many qualities, its ability to be waterproof (with the
                        use of a special sealant for this purpose) and its excellent resistance to
                        heat, traffic and stains make this coating an ideal material especially for
                        kitchens
                        <!-- (link new news) --> and bathrooms
                        <!--  (link new news). -->
                    </p>
                    <p>Thanks to the large number of microcement colours that exist, it is possible
                        to create an infinite number of floor coverings. In our gallery  you will find multiple microcement floors in bathrooms and
                        kitchens.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Colours for microcement floors</h2>
                    <p>White microcement is undoubtedly one of the most demanded colours due to a
                        marked minimalist style that is increasingly present in the interior
                        decoration of private homes and commercial premises. But grey microcement
                        floors are not far behind either. The industrial style is gaining more and
                        more followers to its cause, a style that gives the feeling that it will not
                        go out of fashion no matter how many years go by as it fits perfectly with
                        offices, large surfaces and warehouses and also houses.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although white and grey are the microcement colours par excellence, there is
                        a wide range of possibilities. In Topciment we have multiple colours for
                        microcement floors depending on the character you want to give to the room
                        where the microcement floor is going to be applied. We have designed
                        specific colours according to the microcement systems we manufacture (link
                        to PRODUCTS).

                    <h2>Cleaning, care and maintenance of microcement flooring</h2>
                    <p>Microcement is a covering that does not require exhaustive cleaning and
                        maintenance, as it has very good resistance. However, it is very convenient
                        to use a series of products that will enhance the optimal state of the
                        microcement floor for a much longer period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>For cleaning microcement floors, at Topciment we have specialised Ecoclean
                        cleaners
                        <!-- (link) -->. Biodegradable products with which the microcement floor
                        will maintain its shine and chromatic intensity at 100%.
                    </p>
                    <p>As for the care and maintenance of microcement floors, we have Ceraciment
                        protective waxes
                        <!-- (link) -->. These products provide extra hardness to the
                        flooring to protect it better from traffic, wear and tear, stains, etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tips to avoid problems with microcement on the floor</h2>
                    <p>During the first few days after the installation of microcement on the floor,
                        it is essential that the room is properly ventilated to ensure correct
                        drying. If this is not done, the final finish of the continuous flooring
                        will be far from what you are looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, it is essential to avoid stepping on the microcement floor in the
                        first week after its application. It is also important to avoid spilling
                        liquids that could generate significant stains or damage the resin and,
                        lastly, to avoid moving furniture around. If all these tips are taken into
                        account, there will be no future problems with microcement floors.
