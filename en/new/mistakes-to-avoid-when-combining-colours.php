                                        attention and
                                        not make mistakes. </h2>
                                    <p>In interior design the combination of some tones can end up being a
                                        simple
                                        disaster. Combining colours can be a dangerous game, but accessible
                                        to all. It
                                        is usually thought that this art is reserved for professional
                                        decorators. In

                                        redefining the
                                        different spaces of the house.
                                        <strong>In Topciment we propose some tricks to hit the mark</strong>,when
                                        it
                                        comes to redefining the different spaces of the house.</p>
                                    <h3>Error 1- Mix more than three colours</h3>
                                    <p>In interior design, this is one of the basic rules: the union of
                                        three different
                                        shades in the same room do not get harmony. <strong>Four or more
                                            colors mix can
                                            lead to confusion.</strong>A great idea is to bet on a same
                                            colour
                                            range: for example, from pale pink to fuchsia, passing by
                                        raspberry. The
                                        use of different intensities helps to not make mistakes.</p>

                                    <h3>Error 2 - Abusing contrasts</h3>
                                    <p>The intense tones are eye-catching, but the combination of them may
                                        not be very
                                        positive. Flashy combinations that work in restaurants or hotels,
                                        <strong>may
                                            not work in living rooms because can produce visual rejection.
                                        </strong>A
                                        good option is to try on a wall and if the effect is not the desired,
                                        the
                                        decorative elements can be reorganised or changed to achieve a good
                                        result.</p>

                                    <h3>Error 3 - Not make a differentiation between spaces</h3>
                                    <p>Inside a house there are rooms where explosive mixtures of colours
                                        may disturb.
                                        In places like bedrooms, kitchens and lounges people use to spend a
                                        lot of time
                                        and the unusual colours tend to deplete. The transit areas as the
                                        corridor or
                                        the hall,<strong> allow to challenge all the mixtures </strong>with
                                        the perfect
                                        opportunity to give free rein to the imagination.</p>

                                    <h3>Error 4 - Only think about the walls</h3>
                                    <p>We must remember that not only decoration involves <a
                                            href="https://www.topciment.com/en/systems.html">floors and walls,
                                        </a>it
                                        may also be used in plinths, doors, furniture, or rooftops. Create a
                                        border
                                        within a wall or play with contrasts on the door frame can get a
                                        surprising
                                        composition. Likewise, in this composition will participate carpets,
                                        sofas or
                                        cushions, among others, that have colour and can lead to <a

                                            Everything is a matter of combining proportions , dosing and dare.</strong>

                                    <h3>Error 5 - Darken the original decoration</h3>
                                    <p>The idea of changing can lead to forget that housing itself is
                                        already dressed in
                                        colours, walls and floors in both windows and doors. Start a
                                        composition without
                                        taking into account the already present tones can impoverish the
                                        final result.
                                        The simplest is <strong>starting a project with existing elements,
                                            which serve
                                            as reference, </strong>and achieve a balance from this point.</p>
