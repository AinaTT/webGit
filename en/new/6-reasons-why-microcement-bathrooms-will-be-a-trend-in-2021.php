                        If you are thinking of renovating or enlarging your bathroom in the coming months this article
                        is for you. The microcement bathrooms, decorative coating of high performance, will be a trend
                        in 2021. In Topciment we know very well what we are talking about, there is a reason why we are
                        leaders in the manufacture of microcement in Spain with more than 15 years of experience.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are many advantages of this coating that have led architects, interior designers and
                        construction professionals to increasingly opt for microcement in bathrooms. Not only because of
                        the beautiful finishes offered by this coating, but also because of its resistance and
                        durability, among many other benefits.

                    </p>

                            class="figure-img img-fluid " title="Bathroom with microcement "
                            alt="Topciment grey microcement bathroom">

                    </figure>
                    <h3> 1. Greater feeling of spaciousness </h3>
                    <p>
                        In most cases the bathroom is the smallest area of the house and therefore optimizing its size
                        as much as possible is a priority when deciding to renovate it. The continuity of the
                        microcement gives a greater sense of spaciousness that will be further enhanced if combined with
                        light colours on floors and walls.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the case of white, an ideal colour to make the microcement bathroom look much bigger
                        than it really is and which also combines perfectly with other materials such as wood.

                    </p>
                    <h3> 2.Resistance to humidity</h3>
                    <p>Another of the most outstanding advantages of microcement in bathrooms that will contribute to it
                        becoming a trend in 2021 is its extraordinary resistance to environmental humidity. The bathroom
                        is an area that suffers from this type of constant humidity, which is why it is so important to
                        select the materials to be used correctly. With microcement this problem disappears completely.
                    </p>
                    <h3> 3. Versatility </h3>
                    <p>
                        If there is one characteristic that perfectly defines microcement bathrooms, it is their
                        versatility, as this coating has excellent adherence to practically any substrate such as tiles,
                        one of the star materials in bathrooms.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why we can apply microcement in bathrooms in so many ways, not only on walls and floors.
                        It is common to see bathroom furniture covered with microcement, basins and even shower trays
                        and bathtubs.

                    </p>
                    <p>A versatility that allows you to create infinite designs in any colour you want, as microcement
                        has a wide range of pigments.</p>

                        <h3> 4. Easy and simple cleaning </h3>
                        Decorating a bathroom is one of the laziest things in the world, isn't it? A problem that
                        with this continuous coating disappears. A microcement bath is very easy to clean because
                        the absence of joints in this coating prevents the accumulation of dirt. All you have to do
                        is to use a neutral cleaner and a cleaning cloth for daily care and... you're done!

                        Although we recommend our<a
                            href="../microcements/cleaning-and-care-of-microcement#ecoclean-basic"> Ecoclean Basic
                        </a>microcement cleaner for domestic use, capable of removing any type of dirt.
                        <h3> 5. Enhances natural light </h3>
                        <p>If there is something that occupies and worries when it comes to renovating a bathroom,
                            it is that it is luminous, creating a relaxed atmosphere. Microcement in bathrooms is
                            ideal because it enhances natural light as if it were reflected on it. </p>
                        <h3> 6. Quick installation </h3>
                        <p>
                            As the application of microcement does not require any building work, installation will
                            be very quick. If it is applied on floors, you will have to wait about 2 or 3 days to be
                            able to walk on the new flooring without any problems. Isn't that fantastic?

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, if you decide to cover the bathroom furniture basin with microcement
                            or the shower tray, the application time is a week.

                        </p>

                            Regarding the <a href="../microcements/how-to-apply-microcement-microcement-application-step-by-step">application of
                                microcement</a> in bathrooms, the
                            process varies depending on the type of microcement chosen and the surface to be covered
                            (whether it is walkable or non-walkable).

                        </p>
                        <h2>Price of microcement in bathrooms</h2>

                        <p>
                            The price of microcement in bathrooms depends on several elements such as the difficulty of
                            the work, the quality of the microcement to be used as well as what is going to be covered.
                            It is not the same to apply microcement on the floor or walls of the bathroom as it is to
                            make a shower tray or a bathtub.

                        </p>
                        <h2>5 Ideas for applying microcement in bathrooms</h2>

                        <p>
                            Microcement in bathrooms can be applied in many ways and in many places. The experts at
                            Topciment give you some of the most interesting ideas to achieve a magazine bathroom.

                        </p>
                        <h3>1.Microcement bathtub and shower</h3>

                        <p>
                            For some time now, there has been a boom in the production of microcement bathtubs and
                            showers. Fundamentally because, apart from its beautiful aesthetics, microcement is a
                            decorative coating that is low-maintenance and easy to clean.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But also because of the ability of this innovative coating to create anti-slip finishes
                            to prevent those treacherous slips that we all suffer from at some point in our lives.
                            Our <a href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer#topsealer-anti-slip">Topsealer WT Anti
                                Slip</a> varnish makes the microcement bathtub and
                            shower a 100% safe space.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to this, a waterproof finish can also be achieved with the use of another
                            sealant to prevent water from standing in the shower tray and fungal growth.

                        </p>
                        <h3>2.Microcement on bathroom countertop and basin </h3>

                        <p>
                            A waterproofing that makes it very suitable to cover with microcement the worktop or
                            bathroom basin, two elements that are constantly exposed to water. The wide range of
                            Topciment microcement colours allows numerous designs for countertops and bathroom
                            basins. However, white microcement and grey microcement are still the most popular when
                            renovating a bathroom.

                        </p>
                        <h3>3. Microcement shelves in bathroom</h3>
                        <p>
                            Organisation and storage in the bathroom is essential. Sometimes it can be a real
                            headache when the bathroom in question is very small. Therefore, optimising space as
                            much as possible is a priority.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regardless of its size, opting for a bathroom shelf with microcement is a good idea,
                            since it not only allows you to store hygiene items such as towels, but also contributes
                            to providing a sense of continuity to the whole room. Furthermore, the flexibility of
                            this material allows you to create any type of microcement furniture in the bathroom,
                            not only shelves.

                        </p>
                        <h3>4.Microcement walls and floors in bathrooms</h3>

                        <p>
                            The most widespread use of microcement was not going to be an exception in the case of
                            bathrooms. Covering the walls, but above all the bathroom floors with microcement is one
                            of the preferred options. This type of flooring should be taken into account because, as
                            mentioned above, it can become non-slip.

                        </p>

                        <h3> 5. Microcement basins </h3>

                        <p>
                            One of the best ideas for applying microcement in bathrooms is to build a washbasin because
                            of its low maintenance, functionality, design and modern aesthetics. Whatever the colour of
                            the microcement, the final finish will be very attractive, smooth and pleasant to the touch.

                        </p>
                        <p>When manufacturing a microcement washbasin, a series of considerations must be taken into
                            account, which will be explained below.</p>
                        <h4>Microcement washbasin with a good slope to the drain</h4>

                        <p>
                            It must be ensured that the future microcement washbasin has a good slope to the drain to
                            avoid water standing, which would be fatal. By ensuring this, most problems will be avoided
                            when applying microcement to a washbasin.

                        </p>
                        <h4>2. Reinforcing microcement washbasin edges</h4>

                        <p>
                            One of our experts' tips, although not necessary at first sight, is to reinforce the edges
                            of the microcement washbasin with aluminium trims. Doing so adds extra quality, consistency
                            and design to the washbasin coated with smoothed microcement.

                        </p>
                        <h4>

                            3. Waterproofing microcement washbasin
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            One of the great advantages of creating a microcement washbasin is the waterproof character
                            that can be given to this coating with specialised sealants. With our varnishes, the
                            microcement washbasin will resist environmental humidity and running water without any
                            problems.

                        </p>
                        <h4>4. Wide range of possibilities for microcement washbasins</h4>

                        <p>
                            Microcement washbasins offer a wide range of decorative possibilities depending on the type
                            of coating. If you are looking for a marked water or stucco look and a soft touch, Microfino
                            microcement is recommended.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If, on the other hand, a more natural look is preferred, the best choice is Microdeck
                            microcement. However, a stone or rustic finish can also be achieved by applying Microbase
                            microcement fresh on fresh.

                        </p>


                        <h2> Colours of microcement bathrooms</h2>

                        <p>
                            White, grey and beige are the most commonly used colours in microcement bathrooms. White, as
                            mentioned above, is the favourite shade to promote the brightness and cleanliness of the
                            room as well as the feeling of spaciousness in smaller microcement bathrooms.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, beige and other light browns are an ideal microcement colour for those
                            bathrooms looking for a more rustic atmosphere and style. If you are looking for just the
                            opposite, a more modern and contemporary style, grey is the best ally. In any case, it is
                            important to note that the versatility of microcement in bathrooms allows you to combine
                            various colours.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you have seen, the potential of microcement in bathrooms is immense. These skills have
                            made architects, interior designers and other construction professionals fall in love with
                            it.
