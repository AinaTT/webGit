                    <h3>The&nbsp;Price of microcement&nbsp;depends on several factors, so trying to answer this question
                        is complex. </h3>
                    <p>Only a professional microcement applicator knows the exact prices per m2 (travel, material, value
                        of his work, difficulty of the work, etc...). </p>
                    <p>To obtain a quality result with long-term guarantees, three conditions are necessary: the correct
                        preparation of the substrate, the choice of a good product and the choice of a qualified and
                        experienced professional</p>
                    <p>State and nature of the surface to be coated with microcement<br> If the substrate is in poor
                        condition or the conditions are not appropriate, work must be done to prepare it and condition
                        it before applying the coating. </p>
                    <p>This will increase the price of the material and labour.</p>
                    <p>+ infoConditions prior to the application of microcement.</p>
                    <p>For example, if we want to apply microcement for floors or microcement for walls on tiles, so
                        that the joints are not marked, it is necessary to follow some steps, which increase the work
                        and increase the final cost. </p>
                    <p>Complexity in the application of microcement<br> When the work is more complex and difficult,
                        labour becomes more expensive as more working hours are required to carry out the work. The
                        walls of a bathroom with one or more pillars, stairs, a washbasin or a worktop are examples of a
                        laborious application as they are small surfaces with more corners and edges, in which the use
                        of the trowel is more complex and therefore more costly.</p>
                    <p>The use of different colours in the same environment also increases the hours of work as it is
                        necessary to meticulously delimit the different areas using painter's tape. It is necessary to
                        wait for the colour applied to dry properly and protect it from staining before starting the
                        next one.<br> </p><br> <img
                        src="https://www.topciment.com/imagenes/microcemento-topciment-imagen01.jpg"
                        alt="Price of microcement" width="100%" height="auto" /> <br><br>
                    <p>Total metres to be executed<br> Generally, the more metres to be covered, the lower the price of
                        microcement per m2, and conversely, the smaller the surface area, the higher the price per m2.
                    </p>
                    <p>This happens because there are fixed costs and times (working hours) that do not depend directly
                        on the metres to be coated.</p>
                    <p>Professionalism of the applicators<br> Only in expert hands is microcement a coating with <a
                            href="../guarantee">Guarantees</a>. It requires specific training and attention to detail.
                    </p>
                    <p>A professional applicator must control all types of <a
                            href="../microcements/methods-application-microcement">microcement application</a>, knowing
                        which working method to follow in each case and following the steps scrupulously. Respecting the
                        application steps is essential for a good result. </p>
                    <p>Quality of the materials<br> Topciment is the microcement manufacturer in Spain with the most
                        years of experience in the market. It manufactures all the products it sells except for the
                        tools and accessories. Otherwise it would be very difficult to control the quality of the entire
                        system. When Topciment offers a guarantee, it cannot take the risk of any of the components
                        failing, as the whole system would fail. An example of this is the Topsealer WT varnishes
                        developed specifically for microcement and which enjoy great international prestige.&nbsp;<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Obviously quality has a higher production cost, and therefore a higher price that not all
                        customers will be willing to pay. Microcemento Topciment does not compete on price but on
                        quality, which is why it does not skimp on the latest generation of additives and production
                        processes.<br> </p>
                    <p>The customer must know how to value the quality of the product as much as the know-how of a good
                        professional. All products or services have a price that can vary. If you do not know a <u><a

                                microcement</a></u>&nbsp;we advise you to always ask for three budgets and always
                        discard the cheapest one.
