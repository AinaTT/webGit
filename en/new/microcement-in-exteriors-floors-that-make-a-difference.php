                <h2>Why choose microcement for exteriors?</h2>

                <p>
                    There are many reasons why it is a great idea to choose microcement for exteriors, whether as a
                    coating for walls, façades, porches or as continuous outdoor paving, the latter being the preferred
                    option of experts.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever the case may be, applying microcement outdoors guarantees the creation of incredible
                    atmospheres, as it forms a covering which has a magnificent adherence that allows it to be applied
                    on the most diverse substrates and materials. A continuous decorative coating that combines a
                    powerful visual aesthetic on the one hand, and on the other, functionality in capital letters.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the six main advantages that have made microcement popular for outdoor use:

                </p>
                <h3>1. Microcement for exteriors provides continuity</h3>

                <p>
                    Microcement is a continuous coating that is applied directly on the existing substrate. In other
                    words, it does not need expansion joints. This is a great added value that allows microcement for
                    exteriors to blend in perfectly with the rest of the architectural and decorative elements,
                    providing a sensation of continuity and harmony between all the components. A continuity that can go
                    one step further and serve as a link between the microcement for exteriors and the interior space of
                    the home or premises.

                </p>
                <h3>2. Microcement for exteriors is very resistant to traffic</h3>

                <p>
                    The high performance of microcement remains intact outdoors. This is the case of its resistance to
                    traffic, the main factor that has led to microcement in exteriors gaining renown as an alternative
                    to other coatings such as natural or artificial stone, tiles, concrete or gresite, among many
                    others.

                </p>
                <h3>3. Rain and heat do not affect microcement in exteriors</h3>

                <p>
                    Weather conditions are a determining factor in the choice by architects, decorators and other
                    construction professionals of the materials to be used outdoors. Microcement, if a quality one is
                    used and it is protected and sealed with the appropriate varnishes, will not be affected by rain and
                    heat.

                </p>

                        class="figure-img img-fluid " title="Outdoor microcement flooring "
                        alt="Outdoor terrace with microcement flooring" . width="auto" height="auto">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Impressive terrace of an avant-garde house with microcement floor
                        outside.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3>4. Microcement for exteriors has antiseptic properties</h3>

                <p>
                    Thanks to its continuity, outdoor microcement prevents the growth of fungi, weeds or bacteria, thus
                    obtaining an antiseptic space. In addition, it is a decorative coating that is very easy to clean
                    and requires minimal maintenance and care.

                </p>
                <h3>5. Microcement exterior flooring is non-slip</h3>

                <p>
                    The pursuit of materials that provide a non-slip finish on exterior coatings is a must. So you'll be
                    glad to know that there are types of microcements (such as Sttandard Microstone, our microcement for
                    exteriors) that have this ability and will make exterior continuous microcement flooring a
                    completely slip-free space.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Another of the anti-slip microcements for exteriors is Atlanttic, our two-component microcement
                    specifically for swimming pools. In fact, at Topciment we also have Topsealer WT Anti Slip, our
                    water-based polyurethane varnish that makes outdoor surfaces coated with microcement slip-resistant.

                </p>
                <h3>6. Microcement for exteriors is very durable</h3>

                <p>
                    Last but not least, if there is one peculiarity that perfectly defines outdoor microcement, it is
                    its durability. It is a coating for walls and floors capable of maintaining its performance in
                    optimum conditions despite the passage of time.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, with microcement for exteriors, not only is a highly decorative, elegant and
                    sophisticated finish achieved, but also a very durable coating, almost imperishable.

                <h2>Ideas for using microcement in exteriors</h2>

                <p>
                    Microcement can be used to perfection in many ways in outdoor spaces. Here are some of the best
                    ideas for using microcement for exteriors thanks to its unlimited customisation of finishes and
                    colours. Take notes!

                </p>
                <h3>Microcement for outdoor terraces</h3>

                <p>
                    Microcement flooring is the most common use of microcement outdoors, especially on terraces. It is a
                    coating capable of covering large areas such as terraces in a single piece, thus preventing the
                    accumulation of dirt. But above all for the beauty of its finishes and the magnificent resistance to
                    water and environmental humidity that microcement for exteriors presents.

                </p>
                <h3>Microcement for exterior façades</h3>

                <p>
                    Walls and façades coated with microcement offer the same benefits as pavements. And if it is also
                    combined with an exterior microcement floor, the feeling of spaciousness will be multiplied
                    exponentially. The wide range of customisation makes it possible to obtain finishes ranging from
                    more minimalist and industrial to rougher or rustic.

                </p>
                <h3>Microcement for outdoor swimming pools</h3>

                <p>
                    When it comes to building a swimming pool, it is common to resort to building pools. With
                    microcement pools, the same spectacular result can be achieved with the added advantage of not
                    having to carry out costly building work. This time saving is directly proportional to the saving in
                    labour costs.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Not to mention that outdoor microcement for swimming pools adapts perfectly to any type of space,
                    even if your terrace is small or has complicated slopes.

                </p>

                <h2>How much does microcement for outdoors cost?</h2>

                <p>
                    It may seem that the <strong><a class="links" href="microcement-price">price of microcement
                        </a></strong> outdoors is higher than indoors.
                    However, this is completely wrong. The final cost of applying microcement for exteriors and
                    interiors depends on the same factors: the state of the substrate (if it is damp, if it is not
                    stable, if it needs to be repaired, etc.), the surface area in square metres to be coated and the
                    difficulty of the work itself.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Only on one occasion is the price of outdoor microcement higher: in the case of swimming pools. Why?
                    Because <strong><a class="links"
                            href="../microcements/microcement-for-pools-atlanttic#aplicacion">its
                            application</a></strong> is much more complex and requires more
                    expensive labour.

                </p>
                <h2>How to apply microcement in exteriors correctly</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to apply microcement on exteriors without problems, a series of steps must be followed to
                    the letter. Making mistakes in the process would mean a final finish very different from the desired
                    and expected one. That is why it is so important to have a trained and experienced professional.

                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the six steps to apply microcement in exteriors:

                </p>
                <p>1. Condition the substrate to be coated with microcement for exteriors. Check that it is in good
                    condition and, if not, repair it. </p>
                <p>2. Place the fibreglass mesh on the exterior microcement floor or wall, which will help to reinforce
                    the future continuous decorative coating for exteriors. </p>
                <p>3. Prime the exterior microcement coating with an adhesion promoter. </p>
                <p>4. Apply two coats of microcement base for exteriors. </p>
                <p>5. Apply two coats of exterior finishing microcement. </p>
                <p>6. Seal the exterior microcement coating with a good varnish. </p>

                    the colour.

                <p>
                    The non-slip and waterproof nature of microcement pools, as well as their resistance to the effects
                    of the sun, make it one of the most intelligent uses for exterior microcement. As mentioned above,
                    its application is somewhat more complex. <strong><a class="links"

                </p>
                <p>
                    As you have been able to see, microcement in exteriors is very versatile. All kinds of structures
                    and atmospheres can be created depending on where it is applied. So now that you know everything you
                    need to know about microcement for exteriors, what are you waiting for starting to remodel your
                    space?
