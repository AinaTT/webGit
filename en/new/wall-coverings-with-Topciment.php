                    <p>When it comes to considering wall cladding in some of the rooms, or in the whole house, we often
                        wonder what is the best solution to carry out these important changes and which technique will
                        save us the most trouble and money. We are also looking for a material that will give us quality
                        and an aesthetic and long-lasting result.</p>
                    <p>Microcement, due to its resistance and easy maintenance, is ideal for any type of covering,
                        however, where microcement shines with its own light is on walls, especially those that require
                        constant hygiene and cleaning, such as kitchen or bathroom walls. This material eliminates the
                        need for complicated building work and debris, making it ideal for all types of rooms.</p> <br>
                 <br><br>
                    <h2>Topciment has developed an unbeatable product for wall cladding: <a
                            href="https://www.topciment.com/en/microcement">Microfino</a>. </h2>
                    <p>Microfino is a microcement for decorative finishes with a fine-grained texture, very pleasant and
                        silky to the touch, which produces a characteristic watermark effect. These properties make
                        Microfino the ideal product for wall cladding and a highly demanded product by designers and
                        interior designers all over the world.</p> <br> <img

                        width="100%" alt="Natural wall cladding"> <br><br><br>
                    <p>Another high quality option that Topciment offers its customers is Microdeck. The <a
                            href="https://www.topciment.com/en/microcement">Microdeck</a> is a medium textured
                        microcement that is mostly used on floors, however, when applied to walls using the <a
                            href="https://www.topciment.com/en/microcement/application-of-preparation-microcement-and-finish-microcement">"fresco
                            on fresco"</a> technique it gives a finish that is almost as smooth but more natural than
                        Microfino as watermarks are less noticeable. </p> <br> <img
                        src="https://www.topciment.com/imagenes/revestimiento-paredes/revestimiento-paredes-con-microcemento-topciment.jpg"
                        width="100%" alt="Wall cladding with microcement"> <br><br><br>
                    <p>Both products, combined with Topciment's range of colours, textures and varnishes, give the
                        wall cladding of rooms an aesthetic dimension beyond anything we are used to.
