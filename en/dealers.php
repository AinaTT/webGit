                        procedures of Topciment microcement. </p>

                    <h3>Tintometric system</h3>
                    <p>We offer you a tintometric system that is unique on the market. This computer application
                        prepares the colour requested by the customer within the Topciment colour chart. Thanks to this
                        innovative tool, the colour requested can be reproduced with maximum reliability.<br> </p>
                    <p>Through four variables: type of product (Microbase, Microfino, Microdeck, etc.), quantity of
                        product (10 Kg, 20 Kg, etc.), colour selected from the Topciment colour chart, and finish with
                        which the microcement is to be sealed (DSV or WT), a machine will automatically prepare the
                        pigment to be applied on the product, minimising the margin of error.</p>

                                href="microcements/microcement-manufacturer">manufacture of microcement</a> with more

                            located, so that you as a distributor have preference.<br> </p>

                                factory</a>, invest in our production processes, research and new products. While your
                            mission will be to facilitate in time and space our products to the applicators.
