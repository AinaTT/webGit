            <div class="content">

                <h3 style="text-align:left; ">We seal the microcement to protect the microcement, the varnish gives it
                    chemical and mechanical resistance and the option of having different finishes: satin, matt,
                    super-matt or gloss.</h3>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">After having applied the last layer of microcement and after waiting 24
                    hours for it to dry completely, we must start the sealing process. The sealing, in addition to
                    facilitating cleaning work, will make the surface waterproof.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; ">When using the Topsealer WT sealer, we recommend the prior use of the
                    Presealer primer, which forms a plastic film that penetrates the substrate and covers the pores,
                    avoiding further consumption of sealer. It is applied in two coats with an interval of 4 hours,
                    sanding between coats with 400 grit sandpaper is recommended. To prevent adhesion problems of the
                    protective layer and the appearance of glazes and bubbles, the humidity level of the coating should
                    not exceed 5%.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; "> It will be necessary to allow 4 hours to elapse before applying the
                    polyurethane Topsealer WT over the primer. Apply in two coats using a Microfibre short nap roller.
                    The second coat is applied after at least 12 hours if Topsealer WT One coat is used and after 4
                    hours if Topsealer WT Quick Dry is used (low temperatures and humidity delay the drying process). If
                    applied over old varnish, sand the surface thoroughly to open the pores and remove stains, grease,
                    dust, etc. It is recommended to leave to dry for one week and two weeks without covering or
                    cleaning.</p>
                <!--p style="text-align:left; " > Micro-cement finishes can also be sealed with Topsealer DSV, applied in two coats using a spray gun or short-haired velour roller, sanding the first coat. The second coat is not sanded, it must dry for at least seven days before the surface is used.</p-->
                <p style="text-align:left; "> Pools made with Sttandard Aquaciment should simply be sealed with
                    Presealer, applied in two coats at an interval of 6 hours, covering the entire surface completely
                    and allowing to dry for five days before filling the pool. Avoid any flow of water during the
                    sealing process and suspend the application if rain is forecast.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left; "> The water maintenance products must first be dissolved in a container and
                    placed in the skimmers from where they will be poured into the pool tank. These products should not
                    be poured directly, as they can cause white stains and discolouration on the bottom of the pool. It
                    is advisable to renew the last coat of Presealer every two years, sanding the surface beforehand.
