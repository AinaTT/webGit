                    <h2>Only in the hands of professionals</h2>
                    <p>The application of microcement is not as easy as it seems, it must be carried out by
                        professionals who have mastered the system. Experience is key to leave nothing to chance. The
                        technician must recognise the conditions of the substrate and prepare it, know how to choose the
                        right microcement together with the tools and opt for one procedure or another depending on the
                        finish to be obtained.

                        <h2>Planning the work</h2>
                        <p>Before starting, we must plan the work to give the application of microcement adequate time
                            and space between the other trades. We will always leave the application of microcement to
                            the end, except for the last coat of paint, the installation of carpentry and sanitary
                            fittings. </p>
                        <h2>Tools needed</h2>
                        <p>Microcement is applied with specific tools, although they are commonly used in construction.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Carrier tape or paper with tape:</strong> to protect the areas where the microcement
                            is not going to be applied from splashes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Measuring jug: </strong>the use of the jug allows the quantity of resin (for
                            two-component microcements) or water (for single-component microcements) necessary for the
                            mixture to be dosed. </p>
                        <p><strong>Low speed mechanical stirrer</strong> together with a double helix rod: to mix the
                            microcement with guarantees and obtain a homogeneous mass.</p>
                        <p><strong>Spatula:</strong> used as a support for the trowel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Trowel:</strong> of various types and sizes, made of flexible stainless steel or
                            rubber depending on the material to be applied. </p>
                        <p><strong>Industrial hoover, orbital sander, sanding glove and silicon carbide
                                sandpaper:</strong> once the microcement is dry, the imperfections must be sanded and
                            the dust generated must be vacuumed to continue with the process. </p>
                        <p><strong>Rollers:</strong> are used to apply the primers, the pore filler and <a
                                href="sealant-application">the application of the sealer varnishes</a>.<br> </p>
