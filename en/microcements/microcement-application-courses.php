                <h2 class="mt-5">Price</h2>
                <p>The price of the Topciment training courses depends
                                                        on several factors such as the level of specialisation.</p>
                <p>
                      The cost will be lower in the introductory course, where a
                                                        simple introduction to continuous coatings is made, and higher
                                                        in the advanced courses.
                </p>



                <p> The cost of the material, which Topciment provides to each
                                                        professional for the completion of the course, is another
                                                        element that influences the amount. The material becomes more
                                                        expensive the higher the level of specialisation is.</p>
                                                    <p>The teaching staff also affects the price, as some of the
                                                        instructors live outside Spain and come specifically to teach
                                                        the course in Valencia. This travel costs are reflected in the
                                                        final price of the course.</p>
