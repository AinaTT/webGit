                        <h2>Conditions prior to application</h2>
                        <h3>Cleanliness.</h3>
                        <p>The substrate must be clean, free of dust and grease.</p>
                        <h3>Flatness. </h3>
                        <p>Microcement is applied in layers of no more than 1mm, and the sum of these will not exceed
                            four millimetres, so we cannot solve flatness issues with this material, we must solve the
                            irregularities of the support before starting the application. The <a
                                href="../microcement">Microcement</a> can be applied on floors, walls and even ceilings,
                            the final result will depend on the substrate and the work of the applicator.</p>
                        <h3> Consistency.</h3>
                        <p>The application base must be stable. Substrates with powdery mortars or loose tiles are not
                            suitable; depending on their state, they will have to be removed or consolidated with
                            quick-setting mortars with compensated shrinkage. </p>
                        <h3>Free of damp.</h3>
                        <p>If there is damp in the substrate, microcement cannot be applied. It will be necessary to
                            first determine its origin and eliminate it, we recommend using a moisture meter to check
                            that the humidity never exceeds 5%.</p>
                        <p> The substrate must have undergone a sufficient setting process. We must bear in mind that
                            the temperature and relative humidity of the environment, together with the ventilation of
                            the work space, affect the drying process of the mortars and accelerate or delay the setting
                            process.</p>
                        <h3>
                            <h3>Protection of the work area</h3>
                            <p>We must protect the work area properly and the surfaces that we are not going to cover,
                                as microcement adheres very strongly and is difficult to clean when it dries. We will
                                use protection material common in painting works, such as painter's tape, protective
                                paper, plastic covers...</p>

                        <h2>Preparation of the substrate</h2>
                        <p>The application of the microcement will begin with the priming of the substrate using
                            adhesion promoters and the placement of the fibreglass mesh. </p>
                        <h3>Priming with adhesion promoters</h3>
                        <p>Adhesion promoters have several functions: they ensure better adhesion on any type of
                            substrate, increase its cohesion, improve the speed of application of the first coat of
                            microcement, and prevent the premature loss of moisture from the micro-mortar. </p>
                        <p>Supports have different absorption capacities, so we must use solutions for each of them,
                            promoters for non-absorbent surfaces, for absorbent surfaces, for surfaces that need a
                            certain degree of consolidation or promoters for surfaces that may have moisture problems.

                            <h3>Microcement on stoneware, terrazzo, hydraulic tile or marble</h3>
                            <p>To coat this type of support that is not very porous or not at all porous, we must use
                                Primacem Plus, promoter for non-absorbent surfaces, the process will be as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fill the joints with Microbase and leave to dry for 24 hours. If the joints are very
                                    thin we can use Microdeck or even Microfino. </li>
                                <li> Apply a layer of Primacem PLUS by roller together with the Builtex mesh. </li>
                                <li> Allow to dry for at least 30 minutes and apply the first coat of Microbase. </li>
                                <li> Allow to dry for 24 hours, apply a coat of Primacem PLUS and apply the second coat
                                    of Microbase.

                                    <p>On absorbent substrates we will use Primacem Abs, following these steps:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Apply the primer with a common painter's roller. </li>

                                            hours before applying the mesh together with the first coat of microcement.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3><br>Microcement on cement mortar, shotcrete or gunned concrete.</h3>
                                    <p>For absorbent surfaces that may require a certain degree of consolidation,
                                        proceed as follows:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Let the bonding bridge act for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of
                                                24 hours before laying the mesh together with the first coat of
                                                microcement. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h3>Microcement on substrates that may have damp</h3>
                                        <p>On consolidated substrates where damp may appear, a barrier based on epoxy
                                            resins should be applied to prevent damp from affecting the microcement.
                                            Impoxy solves moisture problems by allowing microcement coatings to be
                                            applied on the substrate.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                            <li>Roller priming with Impoxy at 0.35 kg/m2</li>
                                            <li>Dust with 0.3-0.8 mm dry silica sand at 1kg/m2</li>
                                            <li>Let dry for 24 hours</li>
                                            <li>Remove the excess silica sand by sweeping and vacuuming. </li>
                                            <li>Apply Impoxy by trowel at 3 kg/m2</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h3>Installation of the mesh</h3>
                                        <p>Topciment microcement does not crack, as long as the base on which it has
                                            been laid does not crack. The Topciment mesh is an additional insurance in
                                            microcement applications, it is a high performance mesh, flexible, resistant
                                            and very easy to work with, it is easily covered with Microbase, without
                                            making pockets. The mesh allows the coating to be uncoupled from the
                                            application substrate.</p>
                                        <p>Fixing the mesh:</p>
                                        <p>The mesh can be fixed with Primacem Plus adhesion promoter, or when Primacem
                                            ABS or Acricem resin is used as a promoter, with the first coat of
                                            Microcemento Base. The mesh strips should overlap, no more than 1cm, and
                                            always apply two coats of Microbase to completely cover the grid.
