                    <p>The email-marketing tools of the company Grupo Negocios P.O., S.L.U. use small images invisible
                        to users that are included in the emails. This technology allows us to know whether an email has
                        been read or not, on what date, the IP address from which it has been consulted, etc. With this
                        information, we carry out statistical and analytical studies on the sending and receiving of
                        emails to improve the offer of the services to which the user is subscribed and to offer
                        information that may be of interest to them. </p>
