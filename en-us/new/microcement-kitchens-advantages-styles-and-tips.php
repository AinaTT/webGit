                    <p>Microcement kitchens are the preferred choice of more and more renovation
                        professionals, architects and decorators due to the many advantages offered
                        by this decorative coating. A coating that guarantees unique creations to
                        renovate a room as important as the kitchen.ç
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the particularities of microcement in kitchens is that it can be
                        implemented in many ways thanks to its versatility. In this way we find
                        kitchens with microcement on floors, walls, <a class="links"
                            href="microcement-worktops-aesthetics-and-functionality">kitchen worktops</a>
                        and even sinks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Advantages of applying microcement in kitchens</h2>
                    <p>
                        The application of microcement in kitchens offers numerous benefits. Here we explain the main
                        ones so that you can understand why microcement kitchens have become a decorative trend on the
                        rise.

                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Applying microcement in the kitchen does not require any building work.</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to renovating a room, time is money. Even more so when it comes to a kitchen. As
                        microcement is compatible with practically any material, it is applied directly on the existing
                        surface without the need for building work. In just a few days you will have your microcement
                        kitchen ready.</p>
                    <h3>2. Variety of colours for kitchens with microcement</h3>
                    <p>There is a wide variety of colours of microcement with which to cover your kitchen. From more
                        neutral shades such as white, grey or black to more striking pigments. In Topciment we have a
                        complete range of <a href="../microcements/pigments-for-microcement-arcocem">microcement colours</a>.</p>

                    <h3>3. Microcement kitchens have good thermal and chemical resistance</h3>
                    <p>This coating has good resistance to heat and also to domestic cleaning products. Two differential
                        factors have made microcement floors and walls fashionable in kitchens as well as kitchen
                        countertops coated with microcement.</p>
                    <h3>4. Microcement kitchens can be waterproofed</h3>
                    <p>Beyond the decorative value, for rooms such as kitchens, what is sought above all is a coating
                        that is highly functional and adapts to the needs. In this sense, guaranteeing a waterproof
                        finish in a space that is so exposed to water and similar liquids is fundamental. This is why
                        microcement in kitchens is so popular. With the use of varnishes and sealants designed by
                        Topciment (products page), kitchens with microcement can be made waterproof. But not only is the
                        substrate completely waterproofed, it also provides extra hardness. 2 for 1 in every sense of
                        the word!</p>

                    <h3>5. Microcement in kitchens can be non-slip </h3>
                    <p> In the same way that impermeability is an added value of microcement in kitchens, its ability to
                        be non-slip is another of its great advantages over other coatings. But, in this case, it is
                        also necessary to use the right product. At Topciment we have developed <a href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer#topsealer-anti-slip">Topsealer WT Anti Slip</a>
                        (product link), a water-based polyurethane varnish that transforms any surface into non-slip. An
                        ideal finish especially for microcement floors in the kitchen.</p>

                    <h2>
                        Microcement kitchens for all styles</h2>
                    <p>If there is one thing that characterises this material, it is the wide range
                        of possibilities it offers. For every decorative style, there is a perfect
                        microcement kitchen. At Topciment we propose four different styles of
                        microcement kitchens:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Minimalist microcement kitchens</h3>
                    <p>For those who opt for a kitchen in which straight lines predominate both in
                        the furniture and in the layout of the space. The absence of joints favours
                        continuity in microcement kitchens, a fundamental factor in minimalist
                        design.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Eclectic microcement kitchens </h3>
                    <p> For people who prefer a kitchen that combines different types of materials
                        (wood, plasterboard, slate or tiles). Eclectic microcement kitchens can
                        combine the traditional with the modern, luxury with simplicity.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nordic microcement kitchens</h3>
                    <p> You don't need a huge kitchen to make it shine. The Scandinavian or Nordic
                        style is ideal for small microcement kitchens, as it enhances the beauty of
                        the smallest details. White tones will not only magnify the dimensions of
                        your kitchen, but will also enhance the natural light in the room.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Industrial microcement kitchens </h3>
                    <p> Do you prefer a kitchen with a more modern, avant-garde and urban aesthetic?
                        We propose a 100% industrial style, which is becoming more and more
                        widespread in the decoration of interiors such as kitchens. In industrial
                        microcement kitchens, the combination of walls and floors of this continuous
                        coating in grey and black colours predominates.

                    <h2>Microcement application in kitchens </h2>
                    <p>The process of applying microcement in kitchens depends on the surface to be
                        covered, whether it is horizontal or vertical, as well as the type of
                        coating chosen: two-component microcement, one-component microcement or
                        ready-to-use microcement.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to apply microcement on the kitchen floor</h3>
                    <p>Microcement flooring offers numerous advantages, especially its high
                        resistance to wear and tear over time, impact and traffic. These benefits
                        make it one of the smartest options for renovating kitchen floors.

                        How to apply microcement on kitchen walls</h3>
                    <p>
                        The qualities of microcement walls are not far behind. Beyond the aesthetic
                        component, since any style can be given to kitchen walls, microcement on
                        kitchen walls has excellent resistance to scratches and stains. This last
                        advantage is very useful, because when cooking it is inevitable that some
                        food splashes end up on the wall.

                    <h3>How to apply microcement on kitchen worktops</h3>
                    <p>Kitchen worktops with microcement are becoming increasingly popular partly
                        because of the resistance to abrasion and heat that this decorative coating
                        confers. It is also very easy to clean and can be quickly adapted to any
                        worktop shape.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whatever the microcement worktop you have in mind, the application process is
                        the same. We explain <a class="links" href="../microcements/how-to-apply-microcement-microcement-application-step-by-step">how to apply microcement</a> to the kitchen worktop here.

                    <h2> Tips to avoid problems in microcement kitchens</h2>

                    <p>
                        A series of factors must be taken into account to avoid problems with microcement in the future,
                        such as cracks, scratches or stains. From Topciment we give you four tips to avoid problems in
                        microcement kitchens.

                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Rely on a professional microcement applicator to apply in kitchen</h3>
                    <p>Only an expert can guarantee the success of the application of microcement in kitchens and
                        prevent the material from cracking. At Topciment we continuously<a class="links" href="../microcements/microcement-application-courses"> train professionals</a>  in the application of our continuous coatings.</p>
                    <h3>2. Opt for a quality microcement for the kitchen</h3>
                    <p>Not all types of microcement have the same quality and this affects the appearance of possible
                        problems in kitchens with microcement. Topciment's decorative coatings guarantee unbeatable
                        technical performance.</p>
                    <h3>3. Protect the microcement in the kitchen</h3>
                    <p>Although this coating is resistant, misuse can cause cracks, scratches or stains to appear over
                        time. At Topciment we have created a line of specific varnishes and sealants with which you can
                        protect microcement in kitchens. Discover the <a class="links" href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer">Topsealer</a> range.</p>
                    <h3>4. Use specialised cleaners for microcement kitchens.</h3>
                    <p> Cleaning a microcement kitchen can be done with water and neutral soap. However, to preserve the
                        microcement better and for longer, it is advisable to use a specialised cleaner. For this
                        purpose we have produced the <a class="links" href="../microcements/cleaning-and-care-of-microcement#ecoclean-basic">Ecoclean</a> range.</p>
