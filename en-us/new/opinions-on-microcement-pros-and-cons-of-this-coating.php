                <p>
                    <a href="../microcement">Microcement</a> is a coating that has become increasingly popular over the
                    last
                    few years in interior and exterior decoration. A coating that has become a real trend in the
                    renovation of homes and businesses because of the advantages it offers.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A building material which application is only reserved for an experienced professional. Otherwise,
                    mistakes can be made during installation that can lead to problems with microcement. This is why
                    there are all kinds of opinions about this covering.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In this article we are going to analyse the main pros and cons of this continuous coating, which
                    offers a wide variety of decorative solutions, in order to clarify and resolve any doubts that may
                    arise about it.

                <h2>Pros of microcement</h2>

                <p>
                    The pros of microcement have captivated construction companies and design and decoration
                    professionals such as architects, interior designers and decorators. These advantages have led to
                    more and more people opting for this coating in the renovation of all types of homes and businesses.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Microcement is a very versatile covering with a wide range of decorative options. We can find
                    microcement floors in hotels, restaurants or offices; kitchen or bathroom walls coated with
                    microcement; all kinds of furniture and microcement swimming pools; terraces...

                </p>
                <p>These are the eight main pros that have made microcement one of the preferred materials by experts
                    for interior and exterior decoration.</p>
                <h3>1. No building work or debris with microcement</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the most important pros of microcement. As it is a continuous coating without expansion
                    joints, there is no need to use machinery. Microcement is applied on top of the surface material to
                    be renovated, whether it is a floor, wall, ceiling, swimming pool or furniture. No building work is
                    required and, therefore, no rubble is generated. Not to mention the feeling of spaciousness it
                    brings to any room.

                </p>
                <h3>2. Excellent adhesion of microcement</h3>
                <p>

                    In relation to the previous advantage, it is worth highlighting the excellent adhesion of
                    microcement as it is a super flexible material. A factor that speaks very well of this coating as it
                    can be applied on a wide variety of materials: tiles, ceramics, tiles, cement, plasterboard,
                    plaster, marble, concrete...


                </p>
                <h3>3. Microcement is suitable for interiors and exteriors</h3>

                <p>
                    Microcement is an ideal coating for interiors and exteriors. But you have to know which type to use
                    (bicomponent, monocomponent or ready-to-use) for each occasion.

                </p>
                <p>
                    At Topciment we have designed five different<a href="../microcements/products"> microcement
                        systems</a> with
                    various granulometries, each one depending on the surface to be coated, the finish to be achieved
                    and the resistance that each one offers.

                </p>
                <h3> 4. The thickness of the microcement does not affect the structural load</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the most notable particularities of microcement is its minimal thickness, between 2 and 3
                    millimetres. This advantage means that whatever the material on which the smoothed microcement
                    coating is to be applied, it will not affect the structural load of the building in question.

                </p>
                <h3>5. Microcement is very durable and resistant</h3>

                <p>
                    Unlike other coatings, microcement stands out as a very durable material that does not crack. Its
                    properties are not lost with the passage of time, but it continues to be a coating that is highly
                    resistant to traffic, knocks, scratches and sunlight, among many others.

                </p>
                <h3>6. Multiple finishes and colours with microcement</h3>
                <p>

                    The textures that can be achieved with microcement are unique. Multiple finishes depending on the
                    application, the pigment chosen and, above all, the sealer used.

                </p>
                <p>
                    At Topciment we have a wide variety of <a href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer">varnishes</a>,
                    depending on the finish you
                    want to give the surface coated with smoothed microcement: gloss finish, matte, super matte, satin
                    and even non-slip and waterproof.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The customisation of this coating is unlimited thanks to the wide palette of Topciment microcement
                    colours. <a href="../microcements/pigments-for-microcement-arcocem">Pigments</a> that give surfaces
                    their own personality.

                </p>
                <h3> 7. Waterproof and anti-slip microcement</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the spaces where the use of microcement is most widespread is in bathrooms. This has happened
                    because this coating can offer a waterproof finish if a sealant is used that gives it this capacity.
                    At Topciment we have <a href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer#topsealer-proplus">Topsealer Pro
                        +</a>, a polyurethane varnish that automatically makes
                    smoothed microcement waterproof. This is why it is very common to find shower trays lined with
                    microcement, basins, sinks and bathtubs as well as walls and floors.

                </p>
                <p>
                    But there is more. Surfaces coated with microcement can also be given an anti-slip finish with our
                    <a href="../microcements/polyurethane-waterbased-acrylic-varnishes-topsealer#topsealer-anti-slip">Topsealer WT Anti Slip</a>
                    water-based coating- no more slipping!

                </p>
                <h3>8. Underfloor heating in microcement</h3>

                <p>
                    The last but not least advantage of microcement is its good thermal conductivity. An advantage
                    thanks to which smoothed microcement is perfectly compatible with underfloor heating. In fact, it is
                    one of the best building materials for underfloor heating. <a
                        href="./micrcocement-over-underfloor-heating">In the following article</a> you will find out why
                    and what is the protocol for installing the flooring.

                <h2>Advantages and disadvantages of microcement </h2>

                <p>
                    It should be noted that if a quality material is used and the application is carried out by a
                    professional, microcement will not have any drawbacks. The appearance of fissures, cracks, marks and
                    stains, the problems that most concern the smoothed microcement, are mainly due to failures in
                    fundamental steps in the application of microcement or to the poor state of the substrate that
                    serves as the base for the new coating.

                </p>
                <h3>Making mistakes in microcement application</h3>

                <p>
                    The application of microcement has very specific steps. Altering the order or making mistakes in the
                    process, especially in priming and sealing, will automatically lead to an undesirable result.
                    Therefore, we insist that the installation of smoothed microcement must be carried out by a
                    professional applicator. We describe below the most frequent mistakes when applying microcement.

                </p>
                <h4>1. Applying microcement at too low or too high a temperature.</h4>

                <p>
                    The ideal ambient temperature for applying microcement is between 15¬∫C and 25¬∫C. If the coating is
                    installed at a temperature below 15¬∫C or above 25¬∫C, problems may arise.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If the temperature is too low, a factor that occurs in the winter season, the surface covered with
                    microcement may take a long time to harden properly. On the other hand, if the temperature is too
                    high, the micro cement will harden too quickly.

                </p>
                <h4>2. Mixing the microcement pigment incorrectly</h4>

                <p>
                    Pigmenting microcement properly is key. If the instructions are not followed carefully, there may be
                    an excess of clusters causing dark streaks on the microcement coating surface.

                </p>
                <p>
                    To obtain the wide variety of microcement colours in the Topciment catalogue, the dosage indicated
                    on each label must be respected for both the quantity and type of microcement used.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The pigment should also be shaken vigorously until a homogeneous liquid without irregularities is
                    obtained. Then pour a little of the mixing liquid into a container, add all the pigment and mix
                    thoroughly. Then add little by little the microcement and the rest of the mixing liquid in the same
                    container until the viscosity required for each application and a homogeneous microcement colour is
                    achieved.

                </p>
                <h4>3. Not respecting the steps when installing microcement</h4>

                <p>
                    The application of microcement requires certain steps that must be followed to the letter. Not
                    following them can be fatal for the final finish.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The installation of microcement on floors or walls, for example, is not the same. The type of
                    smoothed microcement to be applied varies. Similarly, failure to condition and level the existing
                    substrate to be coated can cause major problems in the future.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Neither can you make mistakes in the priming of the substrate or in the sealing of the substrate. On
                    <a href="../microcements/how-to-apply-microcement-microcement-application-step-by-step">this page</a> , you will find everything
                    you need to know to avoid making mistakes
                    when applying microcement.

                <h3>Incorrect repair of microcement surfaces</h3>
                <p>
                    When it is necessary to repair the microcement due to any of the previously described errors or, by
                    using a poor quality material, chipping has been caused by knocks, it must be repaired correctly.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As it is a continuous pavement, without joints, in order to repair smoothed microcement correctly,
                    it must be repaired in large areas so that the contrast is not too noticeable and the final finish
                    ends up being a disaster.

                </p>
                <h3>Cracks and fissures in microcement</h3>

                <p>
                    If microcement is such a resistant and hard coating, why are there cases in which surfaces coated
                    with smoothed microcement crack and appear? Mainly for three reasons, which are explained below.

                </p>
                <h4>1. Poor quality microcement cracks</h4>

                <p>
                    Although it is obvious, it is important to point out that not all microcements guarantee no
                    cracking, only high-performance ones do. The lower the quality of the coating, the more likely it is
                    to crack over time. That is why it is very important not to skimp on the quality of the smoothed
                    microcement.

                </p>
                <p>
                    At Topciment we guarantee the professional that our microcements will not crack thanks to their
                    excellent performance and resistance.

                </p>
                <h4>2. Microcement cracks due to filling expansion joints</h4>

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, smoothed microcement does not need expansion joints as it is a continuous
                    coating. However, it is necessary to be very careful about the substrate on which it is applied, as
                    although it is compatible with many materials, it is necessary to take into consideration those that
                    have expansion joints, such as a concrete floor.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If microcement is laid on a surface with expansion joints, it is very important that they are
                    respected and not filled. If this is done, the "microcement" could crack.

                </p>
                <h4>3. Micro-cement cracks due to poor substrate conditions</h4>

                <p>
                    In relation to the previous condition, if the substrate on which the microcement is to be installed
                    is not in good condition, it will have to be repaired. If the substrate is not in good condition, it
                    will end up cracking due to the poor condition of the existing substrate, which acts as a base for
                    the smoothed microcement.

                </p>
                <h4>4. Cracks and fissures microcement on parquet flooring</h4>

                <p>
                    Parquet and microcement do not get along well, because parquet is a material that is subject to
                    variations depending on environmental conditions such as humidity. Humidity causes the parquet to
                    expand and contract, so if microcement is applied on top of it, it will end up cracking.

                </p>
